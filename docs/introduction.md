### Hybrid static and dynamic websites

#### Front-End Integration
Bonita seamlessly integrates with vanilla JavaScript as well as popular front-end frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular. This flexibility allows developers to enhance their user interfaces regardless of their preferred front-end technology.

#### Back-End Integration
Bonita was designed to work with and alongside various back-end technologies, including Node.js, Go, PHP, Python, and Rust, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of web development projects.
